$DEFAULTS
; User may specify their own variables with bracketed words at the nmfe72 script command line:
; nmfe72 myprog.ctl myres.res "-parafile=mpiwini8.pnm" "[nodes]=3"
; which will over-ride default settings of variables listed here (variables must be defined one 
; variable per line).  If the file defaults.pnm exists, and it defines [nodes], this can also 
; over-ride defaults listed in the parafile.
; Order of over-ride is Command line on nmfe72 script over-rides defaults.pnm, 
; which over-rides defaults defined in parafile.
; The advantage to this ordering is that, a generic parafile file can be created for most environments.
; A user may then over-ride defaults specified in this generic parafile with his own in defaults.pnm, 
; that may be more suitable to his environment.  Finally, a user can temporarily over-ride his own defaults
; by giving an alternative value as an nmfe72 script command option.
[nodes]=8

$GENERAL
; [nodes] is a User defined variable
;COMPUTERS=2
NODES=[nodes] PARSE_TYPE=2 PARSE_NUM=200 TIMEOUTI=600 TIMEOUT=1000 PARAPRINT=0 TRANSFER_TYPE=1
;SINGLE node: NODES=1
;MULTI node: NODES>1
;WORKER node: NODES=0
; parse_num=number of subjects to give to each node
; parse_type=0, give each node parse_num subjects
; parse_type=1, evenly distribute numbers of subjects among available nodes
; parse_type=2, load balance among nodes
; parse_type=3, assign subjects to nodes based on idranges
; parse_type=4, load balance among nodes, taking into account loading time.  Will assess ideal number of nodes.
; If loading time too costly, will eventually revert to single CPU mode.
; timeouti=seconds to wait for node to start.  if not started in time, deassign node, and give its load to next worker, until next iteration
; timeout=minutes to wait for node to compelte.  if not completed by then, deassign node, and have manager complete it.
; paraprint=1  print to console the parallel computing process.  Can be modified at runt-time with ctrl-B toggle.
; But parallel.log always records parallelization progress.
; transfer_type=0 for file transfer, 1 for mpi
