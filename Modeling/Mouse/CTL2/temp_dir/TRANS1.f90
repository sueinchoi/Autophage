! SUBROUTINE TRANS(ITRANS,IRGG,GG,NPETAS)
!
! DESCRIPTION : PREDPP contains a library of routines, called TRANSLATOR routines,
!               which perform re-parameterization of the basic PK parameters computed
!               by the PK routine. Exactly one TRANS routine must be selected for
!               each NONMEM/PREDPP run
!               The TRANS subroutine translates (or transforms) the values for a set
!               of basic PK parameters modeled in PK to a set of values for the
!               internal parameters required by the ADVAN. The PREDPP Library has a
!               number of TRANS subroutines, representing different possible 
!               parameterizations in PK, from which the user may choose. If a suitable 
!               translator is not found in the Library, the user may write his own.

! ARGUMENTS   : ITRANS,IRGG,GG,NPETAS
!               IN     - IRGG,NPETAS
!                        IRGG   - Used to set the maximum number of rows in GG
!                        NPETAS - The number of population ETA's in the problem. Certain
!                                 variables are available in GLOBAL MODULES. Their use is
!                                 optional. Not used.

!                                 Variables in read/write MODULE: IERPRD NETEXT ETEXT
!                                 Variables in read-only COMMON: NOETAS, SECOND, LOGICAL,
!                                 NOETAS,SECOND. When SECOND is true, PREDPP requires
!                                 second-partial derivatives of ETAs.

!               IN OUT - ITRANS,GG
!                        ITRANS - 0 = Model Initialization
!                                 1 = TRANS has been called for initialization at the
!                                     beginning of a NONMEM problem; one such call per
!                                     problem. ITRANS must be reset by TRANS to a number
!                                     in the range 1-8999. This number appears on NONMEM
!                                     output, allowing the user to identify the TRANS
!                                     routine being used.
!                                 2 = Normal Entry. On input the GG array has stored in 
!                                     it the values computed by PK (except that were any 
!                                     PK parameter modeled in its logarithm form in PK, 
!                                     PREDPP would have  already exponentiated its 
!                                     typical/subject-specific value and multiplied 
!                                     its eta derivatives by its exponentiated typical/
!                                     subject-specific value). On output the GG array 
!                                     should have stored in it the values that would be 
!                                     computed by PK were the internal parameters of the 
!                                     ADVAN modeled directly in PK (and none in their 
!                                     logarithmic form).
!                                 4 = TRANS has been called during the Simulation Step.
!                                     Only the first column of the GG array need be
!                                     computed as with ITRANS=2. Other columns need not
!                                     be computed.
